# hello-world
Test repository for my first project
Although I'm new, don't let that make you think I don't know much. My motto in life: If there's a wall, there's got to be a way around it! 
You can build a ladder to go over, cut a whole, find a crack to push on, or go around the wall. Walls don't mean stop; 
they're just a challenge to get around and build your confidence. Kind of like coding. It's a new challenge.
Good luck, to me. And to you.
